                    <p>In April 2020, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Templeton_Investments">Franklin
                            Templeton</a> India unexpectedly wound up six credit funds with assets of close to $4
                        billion, citing a lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_crisis">
                            liquidity</a> amid the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">coronavirus
                            pandemic</a>. These funds had large exposure to higher-yielding, lower-rated credit
                        securities. The <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Board_of_India">Securities and
                            Exchange Board of India</a> (SEBI) conducted a probe into this sudden closure and found
                        “serious lapses and violations”. As a result, in June 2021, SEBI barred Franklin Templeton
                        Mutual Fund from launching any new debt schemes for two years. The regulator also ordered the
                        fund house to refund investment and advisory fees, along with interest, of more than 5 billion
                        rupees, and fined the global giant another 50 million rupees.<sup>[15][16][17][18]</sup></p><br>
                    <p>Franklin Templeton said it strongly disagreed with the SEBI’s order and planned to appeal against
                        it. The decision to wind up the schemes “was taken with the sole objective of preserving value
                        for unitholders”, a spokesperson said. However, the closure of these funds sparked panic
                        withdrawals from other Franklin Templeton schemes as well as credit funds of other asset
                        managers, leading to a storm on social media and court cases by distraught

                        crisis in 2018 had a significant impact on the mutual fund industry, including those managed by
                        IDBI Mutual Fund. The defaults by IL&FS led to a series of downgrades and defaults on its debt
                        obligations and inter-corporate deposits1. This situation caused considerable distress in the
                        financial markets and led to significant markdowns in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the
                        affected mutual fund schemes, resulting in losses to investors.<sup>[21][22][23]</sup></p>
                    <p>The defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) triggered a liquidity crisis,
                        making it difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption demands without selling assets at
                        distressed prices. This event heightened concerns about credit risk, leading to widespread
                        downgrades of IL&FS and other non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). Consequently, the net
                        asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these securities were adversely affected, reflecting
                        the increased credit risk and decreased market confidence.<sup>[24][25][26][27]</sup></p>
                    <p>Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, particularly those with high exposure to NBFCs and
                        infrastructure debt, was severely undermined. This led to significant outflows as investors
                        moved towards safer and more liquid investment options. In response, the Securities and Exchange
                        Board of India (SEBI) introduced stricter regulations on sectoral exposure, single issuer
                        limits, and the quality of collateral accepted in debt funds to enhance liquidity and reduce
                        risks. Fund managers began focusing on higher-quality assets and improved risk management
                        practices. The crisis underscored the need for better credit assessment and liquidity
                        management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious investment approach within the
                        mutual fund industry.<sup>[24][25][26][27]</p></sup>

                    <h3>Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis and impact</h3>
                    <p>The Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis had a profound impact on the Indian mutual
                        fund industry. DHFL's defaults created a severe liquidity crunch, making it difficult for mutual
                        funds to meet redemption pressures without selling assets at heavily discounted prices. This
                        crisis raised significant concerns about the creditworthiness of housing finance companies
                        (HFCs) and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), leading to downgrades of DHFL's debt
                        instruments and adversely affecting the net asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these
                        securities.<sup>[32][33][34][35]</sup></p><br>
                    <p>Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, especially those with high exposure to HFCs and NBFCs,
                        was severely shaken, resulting in substantial outflows as investors sought safer investments. In
                        response, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) increased scrutiny and introduced
                        tighter regulations on mutual funds' exposure to individual issuers and sectors to mitigate such
                        risks in the future. Fund managers adjusted their portfolios by shifting towards higher-quality
                        and more liquid assets, reducing exposure to high-risk debt instruments. The crisis underscored
                        the importance of credit quality and liquidity management, prompting regulatory reforms and a
                        more cautious approach within the mutual fund industry.<sup>[32][33][34][35]</sup></p>

                        faced a significant crisis in 2001, which was primarily due to large-scale redemption pressures
                        and mismanagement, particularly in its flagship scheme, US-6412. The crisis was exacerbated by
                        the Ketan Parekh scam, which caused a sharp decline in stock prices, leading to mutual funds,
                        including UTI’s schemes, suffering severe consequences.[36][37][38]</p><br>
                    <p>The government intervened to protect investors and restructured UTI. This restructuring led to
                        the bifurcation of UTI into two separate entities in 2003: the UTI Mutual Fund (now managed by
                        the UTI Trustee Company Pvt. Ltd.) and the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India
                        (SUUTI), which took over the assets and liabilities of the erstwhile UTI12. The government’s
                        intervention included a bailout package to stabilize the situation and ensure the protection of
                        investors’ interests.[36][37][38]</p>

                    <p>Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) defaulted on its debt obligations in 2019. This
                        event led to significant governance concerns and defaults by DHFL in meeting various payment
                        obligations, prompting the Reserve Bank of India to supersede the Board of Directors of DHFL1.
                        The default affected several mutual funds, including those managed by BNP Paribas Asset
                        Management India Private Limited, which had to mark down the value of their investments in
                        DHFL’s securities.[39][40][32][35]</p>
                    <p>The crisis deepened with rating downgrades and write-offs by mutual funds, which had a cumulative
                        exposure of ₹5,336 crore to securities issued by DHFL3. As a result, there was a severe
                        liquidity issue and a drop in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the mutual funds, impacting
                        investors’ returns. DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund, which was a joint venture between DHFL and
                        Pramerica Financial, Inc., also faced challenges due to the exposure to DHFL’s debt

                        with a total exposure amounting to approximately ₹2,848 crore. The crisis led to write-downs of
